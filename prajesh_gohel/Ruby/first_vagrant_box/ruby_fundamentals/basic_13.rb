# Write a program that takes an array and returns the number of values in that array whose value is greater than a given value y. For example, if array = [1, 3, 5, 7] and y = 3, after your program is run it will print 2 (since there are two values in the array that are greater than 3).

# Given any array x, say [1, 5, 10, -2], create an algorithm (sets of instructions) that multiplies each value in the array by itself. When the program is done, the array x should have values that have been squared, say [1, 25, 100, 4].
